##An excercise in multiuser madness...

###Developed by jason.lough@gmail.com

The idea is that a large number of people can type something, but everyones text (individual letters) goes into the community bucket. Everyone can see the letters that everyone has typed, so it ends up looking like :

    sldkHgslge knsalgsdi g jsllkjg owpojsfpa  wgojorwgs do gjlsgj d

You can only 'unravel' what someone said if you know their username. Usernames are displayed on the right. Your username is at the top of that list. Clicking on a username unravels what that user has said. For example, from the above, maybe someone said :

    Hello World

There is a 'automated' user that is basically a bot on the servers end that spits out random characters at random intervals too, for testing.

This was just for fun, but critiques, feature requests, and comments about my moms weight are welcome.
